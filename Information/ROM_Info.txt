-In the original design, PULSE T11 is an option and is generated by the ROM circuit.
The Pulse's purpose is described in the patent document as:
"The six ROM generated word select signals used in the calculator are shown in FIG.9. ROM's [0-7] output a 1 bit-time pulse on Is buss [28] at bit time b11 to denote the exponent minus sign time.This pulse is used in the display decoder of arithmetic and register circuit [20] to convert a 9 into a displayed minus sign. The time location of this pulse is a mask option on the ROM"

-In the original design, IS is bidir. The output of the ACTIVE ROM is picked up by other ROMs to allow ROM SELECT instruction to be executed while maintaining minimum activity in the non-active ROMs.
