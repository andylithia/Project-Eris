HP 65 Internals

Posted by Tony Duell (UK) on 18 Sept 2003, 9:22 p.m.

There are 3 PCBs in the case. The lowest one contains the keyboard 
switches, displays, and display drivers. It connects by a 28 pin 
connector to the logic PCB, which contains the PSU, CPU hybrid and ROMs. 
The logic PCB is then connected to the card reader PCB by a 10 pin 
connector. The card reader head and motor are hardwired to the card 
reader PCB.

The 28 pin connector between the keyboard/display and the logic PCB 
carries similar signals to the 25 pin connector in the HP35, together 
with 3 switch signals from the card reader contacts and the program 
switch signal. The pinout is : 


1 (LHS of machine)
o-- Disp 0
o-- Disp 1
o-- Disp 2
o-- KC1
o-- Disp 3
o-- Disp 4
o-- HDS/
o-- WPS

o-- Phi_1
o-- KC2
o-- Vbsw
o-- Phi_2

o-- KR2
o-- KR3
o-- KC5
o-- KR4
o-- KC4
o-- KR5
o-- KR6
o-- KR7
o-- KR8
o-- RCD


KC = keybaord column line, KR = keyboard row line
Disp = display data bus from CPU hybrid to anode driver
RCD = Reset cathode driver (start display scan)
Phi_n = 2 phase clock from anode driver to CPU
Vcc = 8.2V power line to cathode driver
Vbsw = Switched battery voltage 
PGMSw/ = program mode switch (ground = w/pgm mode)
HDS/ = card reader head swtich (ground = card over head)
MTRS/ = card reader motor switch (ground = card inserted)
WPS = card reader write protect switch (ground when HDS/ goes to ground = 
      corner not clipped)


There are 2 custom chips on the keyboard/display PCB : 


1820-1029 (anode driver and system clock)


           ----------
  Disp0 --|    U     |-- Ag
  Disp1 --|          |-- Ae
  Disp2 --|          |-- Ah
  Disp3 --|          |-- Af
  Disp4 --|          |-- Ad
   Step --|          |-- Gnd
  Phi_1 --|          |-- Ab
  Phi_2 --|          |-- Ac
     LC --|          |-- Aa
   Rset --|          |-- Vbsw
           ----------


Disp = Display data bus (as above). 
A = display anode drive lines [1], segments named conventionally (h = 
decimal point)
Phi_n = clock output to logic board
Step = step output to cathode driver (display scanning)
LC = oscillator components (LC series circuit from here to ground)
Rset = resistor from here to ground, appears to be part of low battery 
circuit


[1] There's an inductor of 130uH (or 68uH for the point) from each anode 
line to Vbsw. Display runs from back-emf from these inductors. The HP65 
uses 4-inductor hybrid modules rather than the discrete inductors used in 
earlier machines : 


1810-0146

1820-1226 cathode driver (essentially a 15 stage shift register for 
display scanning).



           ----------
     k9 --|    U     |-- k8
    k10 --|          |-- k7
    k11 --|          |-- k9

    RCD --|          |-- k2
   Step --|          |-- k1
    Vcc --|          |-- k15
           ----------


k = display cathode outputs. Step = display scan clock from anode driver
RCD = Reset Cathode Driver = start scan (from A&R chip)
Note lack of ground pin -- runs between Vcc (8.2V) and Vbsw (4V).



Logic PCB
---------
The discrete components on this board are almost all part of the PSU, 
which is very similar to that in earlier machines. It provides Vss 
(+6.25V) and Vgg (-12V) to the logic, and Vcc (+8.2V) to the display driver.


The CPU in this machines is a 44 pin hybrid circuit containing 6 chips. 
These are believed to be :


Arithmetic and Registers
Control and Timing
2 * RAM (data and user program store?)
Clock driver and init
Card Reader Controller.


The pinout of the hybrid (60218-00065) is  :


           --------------

             -------
      Vss --|   U   |--

       IS --|       |-- Vgg
     Sync --|       |-- Phi_2
          --|       |--
